# Comparing Two Iterations of My Python Phonebook Project
ðŸš€ Evolving My Python Skills: From Simplicity to Scalability ðŸš€

As part of my journey to deepen my Python development skills, I built two versions of a Phonebook Applicationâ€”one simple and another with more robust features using a database. Here's a quick comparison and the value each version brings:

# Version 1: File-Based Phonebook
ðŸ”¹ Purpose: A lightweight, entry-level project to manage contacts using file storage.
ðŸ”¹ Features:

Add, search, update, and delete contacts.
Data saved and retrieved from a plain text file.
ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes:
Understanding basic file operations in Python.
Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a simple environment.
# Version 2: Database-Backed Phonebook with SQLite
ðŸ”¹ Purpose: A scalable and more secure application using a relational database for data storage.
ðŸ”¹ Features:

User authentication system with login and registration.
Contact management specific to individual users.
CSV export functionality for saving contacts externally.
Data persistence powered by SQLite, ensuring better structure and query capabilities.
ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes:
Integrating Python with databases for efficient data handling.
Working with libraries like sqlite3 and csv for real-world applications.
Designing features for better user experience, like multi-user support and export options.
